# jsmd

## Synopsis

jsmd ensures that you will never have outdated and non-working code in your
README files.

## Usage

```
Usage: jsmd <path>

Options:

  --show      display the compiled JS after execution
  --help      display this help message
  --version   display the version number
```

### How to use it

Just write your README files in GitHub Flavored Markdown as usual. The only thing that you have
to add is the actual assertions. So here is a small example that will hopefully
illustrate how assertions look:

```js
var fs = require('fs');

fs.unlink('/tmp/this-is-stupid', function(err) {
  typeof err; // => 'object'
});
```

In this simple example we expect that the type of `err` is equal to 'object'.
As simple as that.

In order to verify if everything works properly just supply the desired file to
jsmd and it will verify it for you:

```
$ jsmd README.md
```

See the [examples](https://github.com/vesln/jsmd/tree/master/examples) for more
info.

#### Which code blocks get evaluated

In order jsmd to recognize your JavaScript code elements, you have to specify
them either as "js" or "javascript".

To get JavaScript syntax highlighting, without jsmd running the code, specify the code block as "node".

	```node
	var rm_rf = require('rimraf')
	rm_rf('/usr/bin')
	```

#### Hidden setup

Sometimes you don't want to put helper code into your readme file, but it's
necessary in order to perform the tests. In this case, you can simply add
special html comments which jsmd will extract and put inside the compiled file.

```
<!-- js
var server = require('express');
server();
-->
```

That way, GitHub won't visualize the comment but jsmd will be able to parse it.

### How it works

jsmd has very simple flow, that looks like this:

* First jsmd will parse and extract all JavaScript code elements
* It will search the code snippets for "assertions". Assertions look like
  this `Math.min(1, 2) // => 1`
* It will compile the JavaScript code with the assertions and it will try to
  execute it
* It will report failures if any

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install jsmd -g
```

## Tests

### Running the tests

```bash
$ npm test
```
